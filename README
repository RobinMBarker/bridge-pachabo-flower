Method 

    Bridge::Flower::JSON->string(HASH)

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    Text::CSV 2.0
    JSON

This module uses Bridge::JSON::File for testing,
but the Bridge::JSON distribution requires Bridge::Flower -
so this distribution will build and test
without Bridge::JSON::File - but some tests will skip.
